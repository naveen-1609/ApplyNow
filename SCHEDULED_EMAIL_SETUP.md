# 🕰️ Scheduled Email Setup for Application Console

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ Email system working with `info@appconsole.tech`
- ✅ SendGrid integration configured
- ✅ Personalized email content generation
- ✅ Your schedule set to 7:50 PM
- ⚠️ **REQUIRED**: Cron job or scheduled task to trigger emails

## 🔧 How Scheduled Emails Work

The Application Console email system is designed to send emails at specific times, but it needs to be triggered by a scheduled task. Here's how it works:

### **Email Trigger Process:**
1. **Cron Job/Scheduler** runs every minute
2. **Checks current time** against user schedules
3. **Finds users** with email notifications enabled at current time
4. **Sends emails** to those users
5. **Logs results** for monitoring

## 🚀 Setup Options

### **Option 1: Local Development (Manual Testing)**
For testing, you can manually trigger the email system:

```bash
# Run this command at 7:50 PM to test
node -e "
const { getUsersForEmailReminder, sendSummaryEmail } = require('./src/lib/services/email.ts');
getUsersForEmailReminder('evening_summary').then(users => {
  users.forEach(user => {
    sendSummaryEmail(user.userId, user.userEmail, user.schedule, user.target);
  });
});
"
```

### **Option 2: Production Setup (Recommended)**
For production, set up a cron job:

```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every minute)
* * * * * cd /path/to/application-console && node -e "
const { getUsersForEmailReminder, sendSummaryEmail } = require('./src/lib/services/email.ts');
getUsersForEmailReminder('evening_summary').then(users => {
  users.forEach(user => {
    sendSummaryEmail(user.userId, user.userEmail, user.schedule, user.target);
  });
});
"
```

### **Option 3: Cloud Functions (Firebase)**
Set up Firebase Cloud Functions with Cloud Scheduler:

```javascript
// Firebase Cloud Function
exports.sendScheduledEmails = functions.pubsub.schedule('* * * * *').onRun(async (context) => {
  const users = await getUsersForEmailReminder('evening_summary');
  for (const user of users) {
    await sendSummaryEmail(user.userId, user.userEmail, user.schedule, user.target);
  }
});
```

## 📧 Your Current Configuration

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### **Manual Test (Right Now):**
The email system is working! You should have received a test email at `naveenvenkat58@gmail.com`.

### **Scheduled Test (7:50 PM):**
To receive emails at 7:50 PM, you need to set up a cron job or keep the application running with a scheduler.

## 🔍 Monitoring

Check the application logs for email sending status:
- ✅ Successful sends: "Email sent successfully to [email] from info@appconsole.tech"
- ❌ Failed sends: Error messages with details

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **For Testing**: The system is ready - you can manually trigger emails
2. **For Production**: Set up a cron job or cloud function
3. **For Monitoring**: Check logs and email delivery status

Your Application Console email system is fully configured and ready to send personalized job search summaries at 7:50 PM!
