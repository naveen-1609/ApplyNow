# API Scheduler Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified from Render Logs

### 1. **Port Binding Issue** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Render was timing out because the scheduler didn't bind to any port.
```
==> No open ports detected, continuing to scan...
==> Port scan timeout reached, no open ports detected. Bind your service to at least one port.
```

**Solution**: Added HTTP server to the scheduler that listens on the PORT environment variable.

### 2. **Hardcoded User ID** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The scheduler was using `'current-user'` as a hardcoded userId instead of a real Firebase user ID.
```
üì° Fetching settings from Application Console API for user: current-user
```

**Solution**: 
- Made userId configurable via `USER_ID` environment variable
- Added fallback to environment variables for all settings
- Updated instructions to guide users on setting environment variables

### 3. **Email Enabled Status** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The API was returning `email_enabled: false` even when it should be true.
```
üìß Email enabled: false
‚ö†Ô∏è  No users found with email notifications enabled
```

**Solution**: 
- Changed default behavior to `true` when no schedule is found in database
- Added environment variable `EMAIL_ENABLED` for override
- Fixed the API endpoint logic

### 4. **API Endpoint Issues** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: The API endpoint had syntax errors and wasn't handling missing data properly.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed syntax error in the API route
- Improved error handling and fallback values
- Made email_enabled default to true for testing

## Environment Variables to Set in Render

To make the scheduler work properly, set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

### Required:
- `USER_ID` - Your actual Firebase user ID (find this in browser dev tools)
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - Your SendGrid API key

### Optional (with defaults):
- `USER_EMAIL` - Your email address (defaults to naveenvenkat58@gmail.com)
- `EMAIL_ENABLED` - Set to "true" to enable emails (defaults to true)
- `REMINDER_TIME` - Reminder time in HH:MM format (defaults to 07:55)
- `SUMMARY_TIME` - Summary time in HH:MM format (defaults to 20:01)
- `DAILY_TARGET` - Daily application target (defaults to 5)
- `APP_URL` - Your app URL (defaults to https://appconsole.tech)

## How to Find Your User ID

1. Open your Application Console app in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Type: `firebase.auth().currentUser.uid`
5. Copy the user ID that appears
6. Set it as the `USER_ID` environment variable in Render

## Testing the Fixes

1. **Test API Endpoint**: Run `node test-scheduler-api.js` to verify the API is working
2. **Check Logs**: The scheduler should now show:
   - `üåê HTTP server listening on port XXXX`
   - `üìß Email enabled: true`
   - No more "No users found with email notifications enabled"

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

- ‚úÖ Scheduler will bind to a port and not timeout on Render
- ‚úÖ Scheduler will use your actual user ID from environment variables
- ‚úÖ Email notifications will be enabled by default
- ‚úÖ Scheduler will check for emails every minute
- ‚úÖ Emails will be sent at the configured times

## Files Modified

1. `api-scheduler.js` - Main scheduler file with fixes
2. `src/app/api/scheduler/settings/route.ts` - API endpoint fixes
3. `test-scheduler-api.js` - Test script for API verification

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated scheduler to Render
2. Set the required environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Monitor the logs to ensure emails are being sent
4. Test by setting reminder/summary times to current time + 1 minute
