## 🔧 Domain Authentication Setup

### Step 1: Authenticate Your Domain in SendGrid

1. **Go to SendGrid Dashboard**: https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. **Navigate to**: Settings → Sender Authentication
3. **Click**: "Authenticate Your Domain"
4. **Enter Domain**: `appconsole.tech`
5. **Select DNS Provider**: Choose your provider or "Other"
6. **Click**: "Next"

### Step 2: Add DNS Records

SendGrid will provide you with specific DNS records. Add these to your `appconsole.tech` domain DNS settings:

**Example Records (your actual records may vary):**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: em4569
Value: u56612513.wl014.sendgrid.net

Type: CNAME  
Name: s1._domainkey
Value: s1.domainkey.u56612513.wl014.sendgrid.net

Type: CNAME
Name: s2._domainkey  
Value: s2.domainkey.u56612513.wl014.sendgrid.net

Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:sendgrid.net ~all
```

### Step 3: Verify Domain

1. **Return to SendGrid Dashboard**
2. **Click**: "Verify" next to your domain
3. **Wait for verification** (usually 5 minutes to 48 hours)

## 🎯 Current Email Configuration

Your Application Console is configured with **smart fallback**:

1. **Primary**: Tries to send from `noreply@appconsole.tech`
2. **Fallback**: If domain not authenticated, uses `navrosh@gmail.com`
3. **Automatic**: No manual intervention needed

## 📧 Email Features Ready

Once domain is authenticated, you'll be able to send from:
- `noreply@appconsole.tech` ✅
